Quick overview of the Julia programming language at the LilleFP
meetup. Slides are in Franglish but should be understandable.
The programming model was presented with a quick overview of parts
of the type system and multiple dispatch mechanism.  

It was really nice to be able to exchange with people coming from
very different programming worlds and compare their approach,
opinion and programming needs with some design choices of the
language.
