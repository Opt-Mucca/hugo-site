We gave an overview of the Julia programming language for researchers in
optimization theory and practice. The talk was divided in four parts:

* Introduction to the Julia language, key features and central mechanisms.
Example use cases with linear algebra.
* The [JuliaSmoothOptimizers](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers) ecosystem, organization & usage
* [JuliaGraphs](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs) & the [LightGraphs](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl) package, features and structure
* A quick tour of JuliaOpt & [JuMP](https://github.com/juliaopt/jump.jl) for structured, constrained optimization
