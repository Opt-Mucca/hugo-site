LightGraphs has become the central package for working with graphs in Julia,
exposing an interface for both directed and undirected graphs, a concrete and
simple implementation of this interface and a set of essential graph algorithms.
After a quick tour of the package features, we will show how algorithms
developed using the interface work with different graph types, and how to
develop our own specialized graph type as a user.
