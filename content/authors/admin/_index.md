I'm a PhD candidate in a double program (*cotutelle*) between
[École Polytechnique of Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca),
at the [GERAD lab](https://www.gerad.ca/en/) and
Centrale Lille, at [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/inocs)
& the [Cristal](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/?lang=en) lab,
in mathematical optimization for smart grids.
I am currently on an academic visit at the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh.
My research interests are bilevel optimization problems and
pricing for demand response. Other topics I look at include
non-linear optimization & applications in engineering,
integer optimization & decompositions, game theory and applications in statistics & learning.
I am involved in several open-source projects around optimization and
scientific computing, mostly in the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language.
Before starting the PhD, I worked in various industries, from an IoT startup to steel
manufacturing. I did my joint Bachelor-Master in Process Engineering at
the [UTC](https://www.utc.fr) with a semester at
the [TUBS](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/?lang=en).
On a personal note, I read both fiction (mostly detective, thrillers and fantasy)
and non-fiction books, generally on economic policy, strategy
and entrepreneurship (a more detailed list can be found on [goodread](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/110133896).
I also games in various formats (tabletop, video, board, card).  

My academic CV is available upon request.
