I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Zuse Institute Berlin](https://www.zib.de/),
in the [AI in Society, Science, and Technology](https://www.zib.de/aisst) department,
working with the [Mathematical Optimization Methods](https://www.zib.de/aisst/mathematical-optimization-methods) and [Interactive Optimization and Learning](https://iol.zib.de/)
groups. I am associated to the [MODAL-SynLab](https://www.zib.de/projects/modal-synlab) project.

I am interested in the theory, methods, and computation in mathematical optimization,
trying to find the provably best solution to a given problem.
Slightly more specifically, I have been interested in structured constrained optimization in various settings
(see below for a list of topics).
Those include solution methods and software in MI(N)LP and convex optimization and in particular
the [SCIP](https://scipopt.org) framework and Frank-Wolfe related approaches.

I graduated with a double PhD (*cotutelle*) between
[Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca),
at the [GERAD lab](https://www.gerad.ca/en/) and
Centrale Lille, at [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/inocs)
& the [Cristal](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/?lang=en) lab,
in mathematical optimization.

My thesis, defended in December 2020, focuses on bilevel optimization, an extension
coined *near-optimality robustness*, and pricing for demand response in smart grids.
It was co-supervised by Luce Brotcorne (INRIA) & Miguel F. Anjos (University of Edinburgh).

I am involved in several open-source projects around optimization and scientific computing
in the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language and around [JuMP](https://jump.dev) but
like looking around on new development.
Before starting the PhD, I worked in various industries, from a hardware startup to steel
manufacturing. I did my joint Bachelor-Master in Process Engineering at
the [UTC](https://www.utc.fr) in France with a semester at
the [TUBS](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/?lang=en) in Germany and Polytechnique Montreal in Canada.  

On a personal note, I read both fiction (mostly detective, thrillers and fantasy)
and non-fiction books, on economic policy, education,
and entrepreneurship (a more detailed list can be found on [goodread](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/110133896).
I also enjoy games in various formats (tabletop, video, board, card) and cooking.
