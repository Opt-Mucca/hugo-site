I am a PhD candidate in a double program (*cotutelle*) between
[École Polytechnique of Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca),
at the [GERAD lab](https://www.gerad.ca/en/) and
Centrale Lille, at [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/inocs)
& the [Cristal](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/?lang=en) lab,
in mathematical optimization.

My thesis defended in December 2020 focuses on bilevel optimization, robust extensions
and pricing for demand response in smart grids. Other topics I look at include
non-linear optimization & applications in engineering,
(non)-linear mixed-integer optimization, and optimization applications in statistics & learning.  

I am involved in several open-source projects around optimization and scientific computing
in the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language and around [JuMP](https://jump.dev) but
like looking around on new development in scientific programming.
Before starting the PhD, I worked in various industries, from an IoT startup to steel
manufacturing. I did my joint Bachelor-Master in Process Engineering at
the [UTC](https://www.utc.fr) with a semester at
the [TUBS](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/?lang=en) and Polytechnique Montreal.  

On a personal note, I read both fiction (mostly detective, thrillers and fantasy)
and non-fiction books, generally on economic policy, strategy
and entrepreneurship (a more detailed list can be found on [goodread](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/110133896).
I also enjoy games in various formats (tabletop, video, board, card) and cooking.
