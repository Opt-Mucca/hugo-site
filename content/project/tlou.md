The pre-print of the presented work can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00512).
The manuscript has also been submitted and should be published in the coming months.

This project was presented at several conferences, including:

* Optimization days, Montr√©al, May 2018
* NSERC Energy Storage Technology Network (NEST-Net) annual meeting, Toronto, June 2018.
It was under the network's project *Optimal Brokerage Models for the Grid Integration of Energy Storage*.
* JuliaCon, London, August 2018 (poster)

An open-source Julia package has been released
[here](https://github.com/matbesancon/TLOU.jl) for other researchers to
model Time-and-Level-of-Use tariffs.
