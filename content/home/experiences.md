Prior to the PhD program, I had several long experiences combining data, applied
mathematics, programming and algorithms:

- Equisense: research engineer on signal processing and new hardware, data scientist and back-end developer
- Siemens: Master Thesis on the development of alarm chain building algorithms for automated industrial systems
- ArcelorMittal: 6-month industrial placement, using data analysis and process
improvement methodologies to tackle production-stopping phenomena on steel rolling mills
