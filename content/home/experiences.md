Prior to the PhD program, I had several long experiences combining data, applied
mathematics, programming and algorithms:

- Equisense: research engineer, data scientist and back-end developer. Several posts I wrote are from the time there.
- Siemens: Master Thesis on the development of alarm chain building algorithms for automated industrial systems
- ArcelorMittal: 6-month internship, using data analysis and process improvement methodologies to tackle production-stopping phenomena on steel rolling mills
