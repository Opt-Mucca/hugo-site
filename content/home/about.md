# Biography

I'm a PhD candidate in a double program (*cotutelle*) between
[École Polytechnique of Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca),
at the [GERAD lab](https://www.gerad.ca/en/) and
Centrale Lille, at [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/inocs)
& the [Cristal](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/?lang=en) lab,
in mathematical optimization for smart grids.
I especially focus on bilevel optimization problems and
pricing for demand response. Other fields of interest include
non-linear optimization & applications in engineering,
integer optimization & decompositions, game theory and statistical learning.
Before that I worked in various industries, from an IoT startup to steel
manufacturing. I did my joint Bachelor-Master in Process Engineering at
the [UTC](https://www.utc.fr) with a semester at
the [TUBS](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/?lang=en).
On a personal note, I read non-fictions, generally on economic policy, strategy
and entrepreneurship, and enjoy games in various formats (tabletop, video, board, card).  

My academic CV is available upon request.
