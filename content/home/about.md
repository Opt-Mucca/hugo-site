# Biography

I'm a PhD candidate in a double program (*cotutelle*) between
[Ecole Polytechnique of Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca),
at the [GERAD lab](https://www.gerad.ca/en/) and the
[INRIA Lille](https://team.inria.fr/inocs), in the INOCS team, in mathematical
optimization for smart grids. I especially focus on
bilevel optimization problems and pricing for demand response.
Other fields of interest include non-linear optimization & applications
in engineering, integer optimization & decompositions, game theory and statistical learning.
Before that I worked in various industries, from an IoT startup to steel
manufacturing. I did my joint Bachelor-Master in Process Engineering at
the [UTC](https://www.utc.fr) with a semester at
the [TUBS](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/?lang=en).  

My academic CV is available upon request.
