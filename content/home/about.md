# Biography

I'm a PhD candidate in a double program between
[Ecole Polytechnique of Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca),
at the [GERAD lab](https://www.gerad.ca/en/) and the
[INOCS team](https://team.inria.fr/inocs) at INRIA Lille, in applied
mathematics for energy systems (smart grids). Other fields of
interest include data science, machine learning, signal processing.
Before that I worked in various industries, from an IoT startup to steel
manufacturing and studied at the [UTC](https://www.utc.fr) and (a bit) at
the [TUBS](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/?lang=en).
